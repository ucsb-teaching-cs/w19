## Goal
The goal of this lecture is to allow you to have an authentic experience of "a student in the class" working on a programming assignment. We will simulate the experience of students and tutors in lab sections and discuss effective ways of helping students when they get stuck on programming assignments.



We will then do an activity that is inspired by another article by Mark Guzdial on [the critical part of PCK: What students get wrong](https://computinged.wordpress.com/2013/05/13/the-critical-part-of-pck-what-students-get-wrong/) and Phil Sadler research studey on measuring PCK for Science teachers. 

## Lesson plan

* Bring your laptop to class
* We will use one of the programming projects in CS8 as the basis for this lecture. Here is a link to the lab writeup:
[CS8 Forest lab](https://ucsb-cs8-f17.github.io/lab/project01/)
* Starter code for the project is available at this repo: [https://github.com/ucsb-cs190j-s18/lec05-starter-code](https://github.com/ucsb-cs190j-s18/lec05-starter-code)

* Divide into two groups as per the assignements below and follow the instructions provided

## Group A 
* TBD

## Group B 
* TBD

* We will take a break to discuss your observations from this activity and go over the tips in [this handout](http://csteachingtips.org/tips-for-tutors)

* We will then play one more round!
