* Reliabile: This means showing up ON TIME to your scheduled lab hours, keeping up with your commitments and deadlines

* Prepared: Read the lab instructions carefully before appearing for your sections, read the lecture slides
* Helpful: Be respectful and try your best. Say I don’t know when you really don't but seek help from the TA or instructor to make sure that the student received the help they need. 
* Ethical: You must follow good ethics in your ineteraction with students and are required by university rules to report any cases of harrassment or inappropriate behavior to you instructor immediately
