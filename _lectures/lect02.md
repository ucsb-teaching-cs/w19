# Tutoring skits
Below are a few short skits that we will use to reflect and understand some of the do's and don'ts of tutoring!
For each scene reflect on what the tutor did, what would you do differently, suggest a title for the scene.



## Scene 1

**Take 1**
Student: I opened the terminal like the lab says, but how do I find my lab file?

Tutor: It's week 3, you should know that by now! *Sigh & eye roll*

**Take 2**
Student: I opened the terminal like the lab says, but how do I find my lab file?

Tutor: Here let me help. *Tutor takes control of the keyboard and starts typing in the commands*

**Take 3**
Student: I opened the terminal like the lab says, but how do I find my lab file?

Tutor: Here let me help. The information you are looking for is in lab00. Let's take a look. How about you pull up the writeup for lab00...


## Scene 2

**Take 1**

Student: Hi! My code is failing on gradescope. For some reason, gradescope wants two files test_lab04.py and lab04.py. Why can't I just submit all my code in a single file?

Tutor: You could but the autograder won't accept your submission in that format. Send me your files, I'll reformat and submit it for you.


**Take 2**

Student: Hi! My code is failing on gradescope. For some reason, gradescope wants two files test_lab04.py and lab04.py. Why can't I just submit all my code in a single file?

Tutor: You should be able to do that. I feel your frustration. I don't know why the professor has setup such a rigid requirement!

## Scene 3

**Take 1**

Student: So, I type the code here on the Python shell, right?

Tutor: No, you should type it in a blank IDLE file

**Tutor leaves, returns to check back on the student***

Student: Hey, so I just cleared the shell for that *air quotes* blank IDLE file, right?

Tutor: *exasperated sigh* *shakes head in disapproval* Common! You should know this already!

Student: *runs away crying*
---------------

**Take 2**

**Tutor leaves, returns to check back on the student***

Student: Hey, so I just cleared the shell for that *air quotes* blank IDLE file, right?

....same scene as before, redo from here..

Tutor: Refer back to lab00 on how to create a new file!

---------------
**Take 3**

(same as above)
Tutor: Let's take a look at lab00 and see how to create a new file.


## Scene 4

**Take 1**
Student: Hi! pytest isn't working. How do I make the code work?

Tutor: *starts typing* Here this should get you 100%
-------------

**Take 2**
(same as above)

Tutor: Check if you are in the correct path

Student: How?

Tutor: Check the lab writeup

Student: I am in the correct path but my tests are still failing. Can you just tell me how to get my tests to pass?

Tutor: No, the professor has told me not to give away the answer.


## More skits

Work on skits that relate to some of the "advice" below on tutoring dos and don'ts

Don'ts:

* Don't take control of the students keyboard (without asking)
* Don't give away the answer (unless they are really stuck, very trivial, very complicated, or student is extremely frustrated) - M&A
* Don't be condescending - D&T
* Don't be afraid to say I don't know but let's find out.
* Don't undermine the course, the lab, the instructor, your peers
* Don't use terms that students don't know 

Do's:

* Keep your cool even if the student is anxious or beligerent - Mo&J
* Keep the interaction and interersting
* Refer to the lab write up and syllabus where appropriate 
* Reflect on your tutoring/TA sessions

# Homework

* Various assignments related to preparation for being a better mentor, and learning about CS Education.

# Review [H01](/hwk/h01/)

Reflect on your own tutoring, read and summarize a book chapter on how people learn!
